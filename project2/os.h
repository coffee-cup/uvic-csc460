 * Scheduling Policy:
 * There are three priority levels:
 *   HIGHEST  -- System tasks,
 *   MEDIUM   -- Periodic tasks,
 *   LOWEST   -- Round-Robin (RR) tasks
 * A ready System task preempts all other lower priority running tasks. Preemption occurs
 * immediately, not until the next TICK.
 * A ready Periodic task preempts all other lower priority running tasks.
 * Periodic tasks must be scheduled conflict-free, i.e., no two periodic tasks should be
 * ready at the same time. It is the application engineer's responsibility to ensure that
 * it is the case. When a timing violation occurs, the RTOS may abort.
 * When a Periodic task is preempted, it is put on hold until all higher priority tasks
 * are no longer ready. However, when it is resumed later, a timing violation occurs if
 * another Periodic becomes ready, i.e., there is a timing conflict. The RTOS may abort.
 * System and RR tasks are first-come-first-served. They run until they terminate, block,
 * or yield. RR tasks, on the other hand, run until they expire their quantum, or are
 * pre-empted. If they are preempted, then reenter at the front of their level. If they
 * expire their quantum, then they go back to the end of their level. Currently, a quantum
 * is defined to be 1 TICK.
