 * the middle, "Cp" is activated; as a result, Cp is running and the kernel is
 * suspended in the middle of this function. When Cp makes a system call,
 * it enters the kernel via the Enter_Kernel() software interrupt into
 * the middle of this function, where the kernel was suspended.
 * After executing the bottom half, the context of Cp is saved and the context
 * of the kernel is restore. Hence, when this function returns, kernel is active
 * again, but Cp is not running any more.
