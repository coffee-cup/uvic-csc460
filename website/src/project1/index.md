# Introduction

In this project, we build several of the components necessary for implementing a mobile robot laser tag game. Primary objectives of this project are listed below.

* Learn about the architecture of an ATMEL AVR microcontroller (Arduino ATmega2560) and its I/O interface.
* Learn about different communication and signalling techniques, UART, PWM, etc.
* Get familiar with the hardware components and development toolchain.
* Build a simple robot control system.

This project is separated into two phases. The first phase is to demonstrate our understanding of the concepts required to work with each component. The second phase combines the components into one system. Likewise this report is split into two main sections, one per phase. Section one will focus on the specifics of the hardware which was used. Section two will briefly discuss how each of the components in phase one was used, then will focus on the code used to tie each component into one main system.
