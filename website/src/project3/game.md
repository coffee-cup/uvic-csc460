# Capture the Tower Game

## Rules

## Implementation

TODO: remove this note:

This section and phase 1 and 2 below were added just to cover the marking rubrick which was the only place where they mentioned phases.. But I don't know if it's worth keeping them.

>There are two phases in this project:
>
>In phase 1, every team must demonstrate a working remotely-controlled Roomba that meets all the rules, including switching modes every minute, detecting being shot at and then killed, killed if crossed the river, and can only shoot the laser for 30 seconds max. etc.;
>
>In phase 2, semi-autonomous behaviors must be added to complete the final design, thus the Roomba is able to roam and avoid obstacles on its own, e.g., detecting the virtual wall and then backing away, bumping into a physical "barrier" and then backing away.
