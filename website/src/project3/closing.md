# Closing Thoughts

This project was both challenging, interesting, and fun. Using our RTOS made us appreciate the complexity and design of real time applications and embedded systems. We would like to thank Dr. Mantis for teaching this course with eutheusim and making it overall very interesting. We would also like to thank the TAs, Chris and Prashanti, for helping us in the lab and taking the time to provide feedback on our projects.
