Most of the hardware used in this project was also used in [project 1](/project1). However, in project 1 we used the Arduino libraries to interface with the hardware. In this project no Arduino libraries were used.  This section just provides a brief overview of our hardware, while the [#Hardware Interfacing](#hardware-interfaces) section will discuss how we implemented use of hardware components using ATMega2560 memory mapped IO.

The hardware we used is listed below.

 * ATMega2560
 * ESP8266 WiFi chip
 * Photoresistors
 * Lasers
 * Joysticks
 * Pan-and-tilt kit
 * Breadboard power supply
 * Roomba iRobot Create 2
 * 9g Servo motors for the Pan-and-tilt kit
