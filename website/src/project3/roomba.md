# Roomba

All of the commands for the Roomba are issued via UART. We created a C++ class to abstract away the UART communication into an easy to use interface. You can [view the header file here](https://github.com/coffee-cup/uvic-csc460/blob/master/project3/common/Roomba/Roomba.h).

## Open Interface

We used [this open interface specification](http://www.irobotweb.com/~/media/MainSite/PDFs/About/STEM/Create/iRobot_Roomba_600_Open_Interface_Spec.pdf) to understand what commands to send in order to control the Roomba and query the onboard sensors.

### Initialization

Before the Roomba could be controlled, it first needed to be initialized. A baud rate control (BRC) pin was used to set the UART baud rate to a predefined value. When the BRC pin is pulsed low 3 times the baud rate is set to $19200$. Using this baud rate we sent a command to enable the serial open interface. The baud rate was then set to a much higher value of $57600$. If initialization was successful we logged the Roomba battery's capacity.

### Sending Commands

As commands were sent to the Roomba over serial, we simply used our [UART library](#universal-asynchronous-receiver-transmitter-uart). Commands are defined as single byte opcodes. The commands we used are defined as an enum.

```c
    enum OI_COMMAND {
        RESET = 7U,          // reset the Roomba as if the battery was removed and replaced
        START_SCI = 128U,    // start the Roomba's serial command interface
        BAUD = 129U,         // set the SCI's baudrate (default on full power cycle is 115200)
        SAFE = 131U,         // enter safe mode (aka. control)
        FULL = 132U,         // enter full mode
        POWER = 133U,        // put the Roomba to sleep
        SPOT = 134U,         // start spot cleaning cycle
        CLEAN = 135U,        // start normal cleaning cycle
        MAX = 136U,          // start maximum time cleaning cycle
        DRIVE = 137U,        // control wheels
        MOTORS = 138U,       // turn cleaning motors on or off
        LEDS = 139U,         // activate LEDs
        SONG = 140U,         // load a song into memory
        PLAY = 141U,         // play a song that was loaded using SONG
        SENSORS = 142U,      // retrieve one of the sensor packets
        DOCK = 143U,         // force the Roomba to seek its dock.
        DIRECT_DRIVE = 145U, // control each wheels speed individually
        STOP_SCI = 173U,     // stop the Roomba's SCI

    };
```

Some commands, such as driving, required additional data to be sent. The data bytes were sent immediately following the opcode. Multiple byte values were sent high byte first. For example, our code for the direct drive command is,

```c
void Roomba::direct_drive(int16_t left_speed, int16_t right_speed) {
    issue_cmd(OI_COMMAND::DIRECT_DRIVE);
    issue_cmd(HIGH_BYTE(right_speed));
    issue_cmd(LOW_BYTE(right_speed));
    issue_cmd(HIGH_BYTE(left_speed));
    issue_cmd(LOW_BYTE(left_speed));
}
```

### Reading Sensors

The Roomba is equipped with multiple onboard sensors. To query a sensor, the query sensor command opcode followed by the sensor identifier needs to be sent over UART. The result of the query is returned over UART after a 50ms delay. If the data being returned is multiple bytes, the high byte is sent first.

## Movement

Our Roomba used two main types of movement, autonomous and user controlled. We used the direct drive function so we could control the speeds and direction and each well individually. This gave us more fine grained control over how the Roomba moved in comparison to the other drive function. When choosing a move to make we use percentage based speeds between 0 and 100. This allows us to adjust a single `MAX_SPEED` variable which controls how fast the Roomba moves at max speed.

### User Movement

The user was the main operator of the Roomba. The x and y positional information from a single joystick is sent from the base station to the remote station. On the remote station we convert this 16 bit value (0-1023) to left and right wheel speeds for the Roomba. We use four different movement modes. These are,

- angled,
- spin,
- straight, and
- stop

In angled mode the left and right wheels of the Roomba move at different velocities. In this mode the _driver_ can move the Roomba in arcs, circles, and at angles. In spin mode the wheels will spin at the same speed but in different directions. This spins the Roomba in a single spot. In straight mode both wheels will move at the same speed and in the same direction. The Roomba with either move straight forwards or straight backwards. Finally, in stop mode the Roomba will not move at all. The mode we use depends on the x and y positions of the joystick. The following figure shows which mode we choose. The horizontal and vertical bands are the width of a "deadband" threshold value.

The following code chooses a move based on the `joyX` and `joyY` positions.

```c
void choose_user_move(Move *move, uint16_t joyX, uint16_t joyY) {
    // Map x and y from [0, 1023] to [100, 100]
    int16_t x = cmap_u(joyX, 0, 1023, -100, 100);
    int16_t y = cmap_u(joyY, 0, 1023, -100, 100);

    if (abs_u(x) > DEADBAND && abs_u(y) > DEADBAND) {
        // Angled drive
        x = cmap_u(x, -100, 100, -25, 25);
        int16_t left_x = 25 + x;
        int16_t right_x = 25 - x;

        if (y < 0) {
            left_x *= -1;
            right_x *= -1;
        }

        y = cmap_u(y, -100, 100, -25, 25);
        set_speeds(move,
                   cmap_u(left_x + y, -75, 75, -100, 100),
                   cmap_u(right_x + y, -75, 75, -100, 100));
    } else if (abs_u(y) > DEADBAND) {
        // Straight drive
        forward(move, y);
    } else if (abs_u(x) > DEADBAND) {
        // Spin drive
        spin_right(move, x);
    } else {
        // Stop
        stop(move);
    }
}
```

### Autonomous Movement

Even though the user was the main source of control for the Roomba, it still autonomously took over control if

- any of the bumpers were pressed or
- the invisible wall was detected.

Before a user movement action was selected, the sensors on the Roomba were checked. This was to ensure that the Roomba would never put itself in a harmful or disallowed position. The Roomba has two front bumpers which trigger when it collides with an object, such as a wall. We detect this and move the Roomba in a suitable way in order to avoid the obstruction. If the left bumper was pressed we spin to the right. If the right bumper was pressed we spin to the left. If both bumpers were pressed we back up, as this indicates a wall directly in front of us.

In the case of the invisible wall, we simply move backwards if it is detected. The sensors for this are near the front of the robot, but do not determine direction, so in case of detecting the invisible wall we move backwards. In most situations this action is correct. However, the invisible wall can be crossed by moving across it backwards. If we were to continue developing this project, it would be better for us to move in the opposite direction we were moving if the invisible wall was detected. In our robot, all autonomous actions override user actions. For this reason we check all sensors and make an autonomous movement first. If no move was selected we then act based on user input. The function we use to choose a move is shown in the following code. Note that the `choose_user_move` function is the same function shown above.

```c
void choose_move(Move* move) {
    // Check sensors
    bool is_wall = roomba.check_virtual_wall();
    bool is_leftb = roomba.check_left_bumper();
    bool is_rightb = roomba.check_right_bumper();

    // Set base move to stop
    stop(move);

    // Do not move if dead
    if (game_on && dead) {
        return;
    }

    // Invisible wall pressed
    if (is_wall) {
        backward(move, 50);
        return;
    }

    // Both bumpers pressed
    if (is_leftb && is_rightb) {
        backward(move, 50);
        return;
    }

    // Left bumper pressed
    if (is_leftb) {
        spin_right(move, 50);
        return;
    }

    // Right bumper pressed
    if (is_rightb) {
        spin_left(move, 50);
        return;
    }

    // Move based on the users controls
    choose_user_move(move, packet.joy1X(), packet.joy1Y());
}
```

The autonomous movement in this project was fairly simple compared to that of a self driving car or more advanced robot. However, we still designed the software in such a way that autonomous actions could easily be incrementally added.
